The company was founded by Ron de Bruijn, who previously worked for renowned companies such as Alfa Laval Automation/ABB, CIMSolutions and GTI/Cofely. Since 24 August 2015, IAS has been part of Batenburg Techniek.\n\nIn 2005, IAS started to focus on industrial automation. We realized that there was a gap in the market, especially in the food industry. A large part of our relations turned out not to have a good permanent automation party (anymore).\n\nIn 2006 we decided to develop IAS into a mature company because the market reacted very enthusiastically to our approach. It turned out that the in-depth knowledge of the systems and processes, the customer treatment and the delivered solutions set them apart from the competition, leading to the award of the “Certified Premium Partner” designation by ABB.\n\nPartly due to the partnership with ABB, we have grown steadily, which has given us more and more opportunities in public tenders for projects at, among others, water boards. There too, it turned out that we were distinctive compared to our competitors. This distinction focuses in particular on the quality of the solutions we provide and the associated attention to the customer.\n\nWe are proud that many customers agree and act as ambassadors for our company.\n\nWe now have more than 20 professionals working for us and we expect that we will continue to grow. The scale in industry, the pressure on infrastructures and therefore the process complexity are still increasing, while the knowledge about process assurance and systems is only becoming scarcer.","Image":"https://abb--c.eu30.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D20000000oFs1\u0026ids=0683Y00000HLuQN\u0026d=%2Fa%2F3Y000000QLBc%2FtmVr9.EEC7vxPHWoDGPGjYj9.xOzs5dDMPzHWWtESNY\u0026asPdf=false"},{"Authorized":true,"AbbLogoFlag":false,"Responsibilities":[{"Channels":["Technical Distributor"],"PartnerType":null,"PartnerId":null,"Offering":null,"ProductLine":null,"CountriesServed":null,"Expertise":null,"Id":null,"Name":"Motors and Generators","Url":null,"Description":null,"Image":null}],"Address":{"AddressCountry":"South Africa","AddressLocality":"Boksburg","AddressRegion":"Gauteng","PostOfficeBoxNumber":null,"PostalCode":"1459","StreetAddress":"Lancaster Commercial Park, 12 Merlin Rose Drive Cnr.
